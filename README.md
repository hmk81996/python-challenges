# python-challenges
# For PyBank, I struggled the most with calculating the totals 
# in a column as well as with tracking the net change.
# I asked the Xpert Learning assistant many questions about 
# those things and tried using the code in the examples provided.
# However, in also getting help from the TA and a tutor, some of that
# scripting proved unncessary or the variables needed to be more 
# specific to the solution.
