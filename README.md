# PyBank 
I struggled the most with calculating the totals in a column as well as with tracking the net change. I asked the Xpert Learning assistant many questions about 
those things and tried using the code in the examples provided. However, in also getting help from the TA and a tutor, some of that scripting proved unncessary or the variables needed to be more specific to the solution.
# PyPoll
For pyPoll I had more succes using the Xpert Learning Assistant (and probably asked better questions). I had a lot of questions about using dictionaries - both about how to add unknown values, how to add votes to the candidate's count, and how to loop through a dictionary. However, it was really helpful to have a TA review the key and value relationship as well as to help me keep track of all the variables.
